## About Me

I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica](https://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/eng/index.php), working with [Dr. Ching-pei Lee](https://leepei.github.io/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Mathematics of National Taiwan Normal University, from where I also obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics under the supervision of [Prof. Jein-Shan Chen](http://math.ntnu.edu.tw/~jschen/index.php?menu=Home). Here is my [CV](https://jhalcantara.github.io/CV_Alcantara_JanHarold.pdf).

## Research Interests

I am interested in the analysis and development of solution methods for nonconvex problems that arise from
- Nonlinear optimization
- Feasibility problems
- Variational inequalities and complementarity problems

My recent works are concerned with problems inspired by machine learning applications, including best subset selection, sparse regression, compressive sensing, and hyperparameter learning. In general, I work on developing practical algorithms for nonconvex optimization to better handle large-scale problems, which is done either through the formulation of new algorithms or by novel acceleration techniques for existing ones. 

I am also interested in studying the global convergence of classical projection algorithms for feasibility problems, which are not fully understood for nonconvex settings. I am likewise involved with designing new algorithms for variational inequalities and complementarity problems, such as dynamic systems approaches, smoothing techniques, and more recently, projection methods for their feasibility reformulations.
