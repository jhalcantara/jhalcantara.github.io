## About Me

I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica](https://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/eng/index.php) working with [Dr. Ching-pei Lee](https://leepei.github.io/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Department of Mathematics of National Taiwan Normal University from where I also obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics under the supervision of [Prof. Jein-Shan Chen](http://math.ntnu.edu.tw/~jschen/index.php?menu=Home).

## Research Interests

- Nonlinear optimization
- Feasibility problems
- Variational inequalities and complementarity problems
- Fast methods for machine learning problems
